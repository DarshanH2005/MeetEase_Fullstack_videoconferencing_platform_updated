# VideoCallAddIcon Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented your custom SVG icon as a "Add Participants" feature in the video conferencing platform.

## What was Created

### 1. Custom Icon Component
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ui/VideoCallAddIcon.jsx`
- Created a custom SVG icon component using your provided path
- Properly integrated with Material-UI's SvgIcon component
- Maintains consistent styling with other icons

### 2. Meeting Controls Enhancement
**File**: `frontend/src/utils/mainpage/VideoMeet.jsx`
- Added the new VideoCallAddIcon to the floating dock controls
- Positioned between Screen Share and Chat for logical flow
- Used green color (#10b981) to indicate a positive action

### 3. Add Participants Functionality
**Function**: `handleAddParticipants()`
- Copies the current meeting URL to clipboard
- Shows success notification to user
- Includes fallback for older browsers that don't support navigator.clipboard

## User Experience

When users click the "Add Participants" button:
1. The meeting URL is automatically copied to their clipboard
2. A success notification appears: "Meeting link copied to clipboard! Share it with participants."
3. Users can then paste and share the link via email, messaging, etc.

## Visual Design

- **Icon**: Your custom SVG showing video camera with plus sign
- **Color**: Green (#10b981) to indicate positive/additive action
- **Position**: In the floating dock between screen share and chat
- **Tooltip**: Shows "Add Participants" on hover
- **Animation**: Follows the same hover and scaling effects as other dock items

## Technical Details

- Properly centered SVG prevents displacement issues
- Compatible with the existing FloatingDock component
- Uses the existing notification system for user feedback
- Cross-browser clipboard functionality with fallback

The icon is now fully integrated and ready to use in your video conferencing platform!
